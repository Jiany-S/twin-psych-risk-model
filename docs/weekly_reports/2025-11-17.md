# Weekly Report — 2025-11-17

## Highlights
- Finalized repository skeleton for the cognitive risk forecasting project.
- Defined worker profile representation (experience, specialization, physiological baselines) and EMA update rule.
- Scoped preprocessing flow for WESAD-like datasets placed under `data/raw/`.

## Risks / Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Limited availability of labeled cognitive risk data | Medium | Use public stress datasets as proxy tasks and emphasize personalization transfer. |
| Personalized normalization drift | High | Update EMA only on safe samples; maintain fallback global stats. |

## Next Steps
1. Implement preprocessing script with CLI entry point.
2. Build PyTorch Lightning experiments for TFT and baselines.
3. Design evaluation notebook to interpret calibration and risk thresholds.
